## Architecture overview
    Technologies Used
-   Android/JAVA
-   Gradle
- **Activities and Fragments** are for presentation only where data is passed from an activity to a fragment using an adapter which fetches data from an array thus acting as a bridge between an array container and the class that receives the information to be displayed in a fragment.
- **Recycle view** is used like a scroll view to enable scrap view when scrolling through content that dont fit a screen to hold them into memory and only display them when they are viscible on the screen.


## Version Control
Git is frequently used to commit and push changes and the master branch is used only for changes that have been verified and ready for production.

Daily development and enhancements is done in the dev- branch  then its tested and verified before being pushed to master branch for production.
Keep commits intentional and self-explanatory.
